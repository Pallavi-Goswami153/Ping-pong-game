# Ping-pong-game
I created a Ping Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JS. Here's a brief overview:

- HTML: Created a canvas for the game and added paddle and ball elements.
- CSS: Styled the game elements for a visually appealing interface.
- JS:
    - Set up the game loop and initialized the game state.
    - Added event listeners for paddle movement and collision detection.
    - Implemented ball movement, bouncing, and scoring logic.
    - Displayed a game over message when the game ends.

The game works as follows:

- The ball moves towards the player's paddle.
- The player moves their paddle to hit the ball.
- The ball bounces back and forth between paddles.
- Points are scored when the ball misses a paddle.
- The game ends when a player reaches a certain score.
